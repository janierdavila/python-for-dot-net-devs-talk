# What is this about?

This repository contains all C# and Python sample code used in my "Python for .NET Devs" presenation.

So far, this presentation has been given twice, both times at [South Florida Code Camp](https://www.fladotnet.com/codecamp/Home.aspx) 2019 and 2020 editions. 

## Abstract

Python has increased in popularity in the recent years. Even Microsoft has adopted it as a main supported technology in Azure, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, SQL Server, etc. However, my experience has shown that Python continues to be a foreign language for most .NET developers. Are you a .NET developer? Have you ever wondered what you could use Python for? Curious as to how it compares to your current toolset? Then this session might be for you. This session assumes no prior Python knowledge. I would provide introduction to the Python programming language, at times comparing it with C#; as such familiarity with C# is assumed, but not required. This is a beginner's session.
